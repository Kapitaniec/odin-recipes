    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A small pinch of saffron goes a long way in imparting a vibrant golden hue
      and floral fragrance to this creamy lobster risotto. Sommelier Tonya Pitts
      recommends pairing it with a white Bordeaux.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups bottled clam juice (such as Bar Harbor)</li>
      <li>3 cups water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 cup yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cup carrot, cubed (1/8-inch pieces)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup celery, cubed (1/8-inch pieces)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice, uncooked</li>
      <li>Pinch of best-quality saffron threads (such as Diaspora Co.)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (4 ounces) dry white wine</li>
      <li>
        1 pound lobster meat (such as Luke's Lobster), cooked (about 3 cups)
      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3/4 cup (about 3 ounces) Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
      <li>Fresh chives, sliced, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook clam juice and 3 cups water in a medium saucepan over medium-low,
        undisturbed, until steaming, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to
        medium-low, and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high. Add onion,
        carrot, and celery; cook, stirring often, until slightly softened, about
        5 minutes. Add rice and saffron; cook, stirring constantly, until rice
        is toasted, about 1 minute. Add wine; cook, stirring often, until almost
        absorbed, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 cup hot clam juice mixture to rice mixture; cook, stirring often,
        until almost absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Continue adding clam juice
        mixture, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring until clam juice mixture is almost
        absorbed after each addition, until rice is al dente and mixture is
        creamy, 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove rice mixture from heat; gently stir in lobster, salt, and pepper.
        Gradually stir in Parmesan cheese. Stir in additional clam juice
        mixture, a splash at a time, to loosen risotto, if needed. Discard
        remaining clam juice mixture. Divide risotto evenly among 4 bowls;
        garnish with chives.
      </li>
    </ol>
